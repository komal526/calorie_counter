Calorie counter is the single page web application developed with React.js,Node.js and MongoDB. It is designed to address the common challenges many people face to accurately tracking their nutrition. This website helps users to track of their health in easy and smart way. 
You can calculate your BMI (Body Mass Index) to understand whether your weight is healthy according to your height or not. 
According to your BMI, the website provides personalized health suggestions. If you are underweight, it guides you on how to gain weight in a healthy way. If you are overweight, it helps you understand how to lose weight safely and effectively. And if your weight is within the healthy range, it suggests how to maintain your current fitness level. Based on your daily calorie intake tracking, it also recommends what foods you should eat and what to avoid to achieve and maintain a balanced, healthy lifestyle.
The main goal of this project is to track your daily diet and calorie intake to help you build a body that is healthy from the inside.
The Calorie Counter is unique because it doesn’t just calculate BMI or count calories — it provides personalized guidance based on the user’s BMI and daily habits. It helps users understand what to eat, what to avoid, and how to reach or maintain a healthy weight in a practical way. Unlike most calorie-tracking apps, this project focuses on overall health improvement from the inside, not just numbers. It connects nutrition tracking, BMI analysis, and healthy food suggestions into one simple, interactive platform.
